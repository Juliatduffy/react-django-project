## US State Photo Album
Julia Duffy | 12-7-2025

The website is a simple, "US state photo album" that displays a grid of U.S. States and facts about each state (i.e., state flower, population), that is pulled from a django backend.  

I plan to turn this website into something more interesting in the future. My main goal in building this was to gain familiarity with this tech stack and to learn react.
