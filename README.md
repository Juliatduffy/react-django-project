#US State Photo Album

I am making this project to study for my web dev final exam and learn react.

The website is a simple "state explorer" that displays a grid of U.S. States and facts about each state (i.e. state flower, population), that is pulled from a django backend.  

TODO: could be cool to add an interactive map page
